# URL Catching Game

![Gameplay](gameplay.gif)

Catch the falling items by moving up and down, all in the URL. Play it [here](https://tomasohchom.github.io/catch)! Inspired by [URL Snake](https://demian.ferrei.ro/snake).

NOTE: Instead of displaying whitespaces, I decided to invert the flips to get the full Braille characters as the "empty" space. The entities are technically represented as "holes" in the characters.
